## INTRODUCTION
As legalized sports betting continues to grow, the amount of money wagered on sporting events is hitting unprecedented levels. With the ease to access large data samples, the ability to identify trends is not only interesting but could also be profitable. The predictive data models created by the Sportsbooks are factoring in hundreds of variables to mitigate the risk of the casinos. During my project, I wanted to look at a few of these variables to see if there was any correlation to an outcome. With the casinos having the ability to move the lines to balance their risk, I wanted to identify teams with a stronger track record of covering spreads in the recent years (10 year sample size). 

## Cloning Repo and Installing Relevant Packages
1. Confirm that a version of Python 3 has been installed on your local machine
2. Open Git Bash and navigate to where you would like to clone my Repository using the CD "desired path" command
3. Run git clone "git@github.com:dannysontag1/NFL_Betting_Lines.git" or you can grab the key directly from my repo
4. Create a virtual environment - instructions on creating a virtual environment (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
5. To make sure you have all the necessary packages to run my program, run "py -m pip install -r requirements.txt" for Windows or "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt" for Unix/macOS. 

## Running my Project From Jupyter Notebook
1. Bring up the command prompt and once again navigate to the cloned Repository using the CD "desired path" command
2. From the command prompt run "jupyter notebook" and this should launch a browser window with all my cloned repo files
3. Jupyter Notebook should be installed from my requirements.txt but if you get an error run "pip install jupyter" and then run "jupyter notebook"
4. Open "NFL Data and Sport Betting Analysis.ipynb" and run the program

## Requirements Met
My project has met the following requires outlined by Code Kentucky:
1. Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.). 
2. Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.  
3. Clean your data and perform a SQL join with your data sets using either plain sql or the pandasql Python library.
4. Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.
5. Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up
6. Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don’t have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.
